It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"# The Orb\r\n\r\nThe Orb is an Arduino based ambiant device representing the state of Jenkins build jobs. It connects wirelessly to the Internet, parses the build file at /cc.xml and interpret the results.\r\n\r\n## Color Codes\r\n===\r\n\r\n###GREEN\r\n* SOLID - Most recent build successfull\r\n* PULSING SLOW - Most recent successfull build in progress\r\n* ALTERNATING WITH RED - Schroedinger state. Error parsing build xml file.\r\n\r\n###RED \r\n* SOLID - Most recent build failed\r\n* PULSING SLOW - Most recent failed build in progress\r\n* PULSING FAST - One or more build in failed state\r\n* ALTERNATING WITH GREEN - Schroedinger state. Error parsing build xml file.\r\n\r\n###BLUE\r\n* SOLID - In WiFi setup mode (see below)\r\n* PULSING SLOW - Failed connecting to host\r\n* PULSING FAST - No WiFi network\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there is no build activity and all build are in a success state, the Orb will turn off after 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Change WiFi Settings\r\n===\r\n\r\nOpen the Orb, toggle switch #1 to SETUP, cycle power.\r\n\r\nOn a computer, join adhoc network Wifly-GSX-dd. Make sure you have a self assigned IP address in the 169.254.1.x subnet.\r\n\r\nTelnet to the Orb and enter command mode with ```$$$```. You can then enter your WiFi settings.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> telnet 169.254.1.1 2000\r\n$$$\r\nset wlan ssid YOUR-SSID\r\nset wlan phrase YOUR-PASSWORD\r\nset wlan auth 4 (0=none, 4=WPA2)\r\nset ip dhcp 1\r\nset wlan join 2\r\nsave\r\nreboot\r\n```\r\n\r\nToggle switch #1 to WIFI, cycle power.\r\n\r\n##Jenkins Configuration\r\n===\r\nMake sure that READ permissions is granted for /cc.xml. This opens a hole in security to allow unauthenticated access to /cc.xml at the root of the server. This URI provides monitoring capability to a range of desktop clients. Enabling this option reveals limited information about your build to the whole world. Use with care.\r\n\r\n##Unit Tests\r\n===\r\n\r\n```\r\nrake all\r\n```"}
